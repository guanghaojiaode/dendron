The position and the momentum of a particle can never be determined
precisely at the same time.

Heisenberg has said: If you want to measure one precisely, the other one
will be definitely disturbed. When we observe a system, it is determined
to be alterd!

However, this is not convinced:

-   He did not point out how to measure the momentum of a particle.

-   The experiment has not been done to convince it.
