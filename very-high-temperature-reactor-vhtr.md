It generates actually a by-product $H_2$. This is a pebble-bed reactor.

A large amount of pebbles form the core.

In each pebble, there is graphite with fuel in it. The pebble is coated
with ceramics.

The inert gas is used.

This kind of design is extremely flexible.

VHTR actually concludes also the [[supercritical-water-cooled-reactor-scwr]], and other reactors using
