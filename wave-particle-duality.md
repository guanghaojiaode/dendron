In the initial [[double-slit-experiment]], scientists
discovered that photons interfered with each other and concluded that
light was a wave.

But in the [[photoelectric-effect]] experiment, when they
hit a metal surface with a beam of light, a spark was produced.

According to the [[Wave Model]],
the increase of the intensity of the beam would lead to the increase of
the emission electrons.

However, the quantity of the emission electrons had nothing to do with
the intensity but is only related to the frequency of the beam.

More significantly, only when the frequency higher than a threshold
value, the electrons can be emitted.

This phenomenon brought doubt to the scientists, because what the
experiments results told them was that photons are particles!

The [[quantum-mechanics]] is
established inspired by this phenomenon. And the wave-particle duality
is discoverd in this way.

Einstein then come up with this formula: $E = h \cdot \gamma$. $h$ is
Planck constant, $\gamma$ is the frequency.

There is a very basic law that the frequency is inversely proportional
to wavelength: $c = \lambda \cdot \gamma$.

By the [[planck-einstein-relation]]
($E = h \cdot \gamma = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$), the wave theory and the
partical theory is related to each other.

Actually it depends on the scale of the particle, which model (wave or
particle) to use.

small --\> particle

big --\> wave

The rest mass of a photon is 0. Because of the [[theory-of-relativity]], the photon has
momentum.

Whether a photon is more like a wave or a particle, is related to his
scale.
