The radiation with engough high energy could ionise the atoms to ions.
The ionization is the process that the electrons are split out from the
nuclei and an atom becomes a positive nuclei and electron(s). The cells
of creatures are built up with atoms. The ionization of the atoms in
creatures could lead to cancer.
