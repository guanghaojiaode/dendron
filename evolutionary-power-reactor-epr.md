EPR is actually a development of a [[pressured-water-reactors-pwrs]] to use highly enriched uranium oxide or the mixture of uranium and thorium (MOX).

Compare to the PWRs:

It is more compact than the normal Generation III reactors, thus it can be build in a shorter time. It also has many safety features and produced much less waste.

It has 4 separeted and independent emergency systems.

It is also interesting that it is resistant to the aeroplane crash and earthquake.
