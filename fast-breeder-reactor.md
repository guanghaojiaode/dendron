FBR: During operation, this kind of reactor breeds (generates) more fuel than it consumes. There's a breeder blanket surrounding the fissile core. No moderator is needed. However, the temperature of the core is high and a good coolant is needed. All current coolant in the reactor is a liquid metal, e.g. sodium, lead, or...

Most countries have stopped developing FBRs. One reason is that there is less need for nuclear weapons. But this technology has inspired the development of the [[nuclear-reactor-generation-iv]].

The fast breeder reactor uses the depleted nuclear waste as a form of energy and change U to usable Pu: 0.7% U-235 + 99.3% U-238 (see [[uranium]] --\> Pu-239 + Pu-241 (see [[plutoninum-blank]] and other isotopes of Pu. The Pu-239 and Pu-241 undergo the same way as U-235 to produce heat, see the Uranium reaction in [[uranium]].

In this kind of reactor, 75% of the energy in the natural uranium fuel can be used, while in the light water reactor, this value is only 1%!
