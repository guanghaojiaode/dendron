In the beginning, the scientists have less knowledge of the degradation of the graphite under exposure to high flux neutrons.

1. graphite degradation
2. metallic uranium in the core overheated
3. fresh air cooling turned up
4. not noticing that some of the uranium and graphite were already alight
5. blast furnace
6. $CO_2$-cooling turned on but was unable to check the fire

7. water-cooling turned on -- problematic because the high temperature would make it possible to change the water into oxygen and hydrogen, which could lead to an explosion
8. fortunatelly it did not explode
9. but still, plenty of radioactive materials were released into the air
