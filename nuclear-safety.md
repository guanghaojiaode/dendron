# Our subjective assessment

Generally, subjective assessment of people enlarges their fear to the
unfamilier things. The outcome of a nuclear could be hazardous, but with
adequate safety tratigies the risk can be reduced significantly.
Therefore, one main aim of nuclear safety is to assess the risk of
nuclear power properly and give citizens an rational understanding to
the risk of nuclear safety.

Actually there\'s no absolute criteria for the evaluation in nuclear
safety, to make sure that this is absolutely \"safe\". But there are
still some numbers that we can say this is theoretically enough safe.

Nuclear Power is not as horrible and dangerous
