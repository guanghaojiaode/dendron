# Definition

In some definitions, it is defined as all fast reactors including fast breeder reactors. But some are defined as not designed to breed more fuel, unlike [[fast-breeder-reactor]]. Anyway, the definitions seem to be not so clear and the line between them is not so clear. For example, the SFR can be adjusted to breeder, converter, and burner, depending on different conversion ratio.

# Features

[[fast-reactor-fr]] has higher
efficiency than normal reactors, 60% higher. [@zohuriThermodynamicsNuclearPower2019] (P. 496) Bubbles are more present in the process, so reactors are more
tend to heat up rather than cool down. *I wonder what this has to do with the fact that this reactor has a positive [[void-coefficient]].

Typical fast reactors are [[sodium-cooled-fast-reactor-sfr]], [[lead-cooled-fast-reactor-lfr]], [[gas-cooled-fast-reactor-gfr]].

Pros:

- minimize the nuclear proliferation
- extract more energy from the fuel.

Cons:

- Some people will say that the reactor is unpredictable very tedious to use. [@zohuriThermodynamicsNuclearPower2019] (P. 496)
