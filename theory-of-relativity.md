This is very interesting that Einstein derived the time dilation (The
time seems to be different because of the movement.) from very simple
examples and equations.

It is very important for the understanding, also astonishing that:

For a moving person and a stationary person, the effect of the
relativity is the same. That means, they both think that the time of the
other one is slowed down.

Actually the relative movement leads to the change in relative
observation of time, length and mass.

It is also very interesting that Einstein convinced that the
acceleration is also relative. There is no absolute acceleration.
