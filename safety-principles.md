# Fail-Safe technology

When the reactor runs outside its designed parameters, it shut itself
down automatically.

Two severe hazard in human history has reminded us that every nuclear
power plant should and must have this technology:

-   [[accident-three-miles-island-1979]] (the hazard was
    prevented by the Fail-Safe technology)
-   [[accident-chernobyl-1986]]
    (lack of Fail-Safe technology)

The nuclear hazards could be completely avoided, if the fail-safe
technologies were employed. Human is unstable, and the nuclear power
plant can only be licensed for having fail-safe technologies.
