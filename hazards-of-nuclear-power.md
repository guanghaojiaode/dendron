# Source of the hazard

There are large amount of rocks to be processed. The mining is operated
generally in open pit mines. The workers should wear face masks all the
time. The workers will unavoidably inhale the dust. The accumulation of
the dust in their body leads to serious illness.

Some uranium is deep-minded. It is more problematic. The decay of
uranium is alpha emitting decay. In this process, the radioactive gas
radon-222 will be generated. The radon-222 will accummulate under ground
and can be hazardous when mining without ventilator.

During the World War II, human lack of understanding to the danger of
the radioactivity. There were many incorrect usage or handling with
radioactive materials.

Some terrorists may also gathering radioactive materials and make bombs.

# Notice

There is not so much fuel in a nuclear plant, it is under the weapon-grade.
