# What is criticality

> If we adjust the neutron absorption so that the neutron flux remains
> constant in time, the reactor is said to be critical. If the neutron
> flux can only increase with the help of the delayed neutrons, it is
> called delayed supercritical, and if the prompt neutrons alone cause
> the neutron flux to increase, the reactor is called prompt
> supercritical. Of course, we\'d better not do that. That would be too
> fast. The multiplication factor should therefore not be much greater
> than one.
