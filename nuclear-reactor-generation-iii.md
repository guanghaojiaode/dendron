The Advanced Boiling Water Reactors (ABWRs) are the first kind of
Generation III reactor in the world. There are also Advanced Pressured
Water Reactors (APWRs) and other reactors:

-   EPR (Evolutionary Power Reactor)
-   AP1000 (Advanced Passive PWR)

And actually these two types of reactors are regarded as Nuclear
Reactors Generation III+.

It uses pump to circulate the fluid inside the reactor. This improves
the cost and the thermal efficiency.
