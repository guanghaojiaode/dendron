It is very interesting that most of the first generation of nuclear
reactors are incorporated with production of Platinum. This is used for
the weapons. But when a peaceful world came, the production of Platinum
are shut down. However, The producted Platinum can be used for modern
reactors. Therefore, the nuclear reactors of generation 1 are already
obsolete.
