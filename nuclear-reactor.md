# Process

## neutron emitter

## uranium enrichment

-   enriched $U-235$:3%\~5%
-   $UF_6$ is used in every enrichment method

## nuclear fission

-   neutron + $U_{235}$ $\rightarrow$ $U_{236}$ $\rightarrow$
    $Kr_{92}$ + $Ba_{141}$ + neutrons

# nuclear reactor

-   nuclear fussion --\> thermal energy
-   questions:
    -   difference between fast neutrons, thermal neutrons (and cold
        neutrons)...

## Nuclear fussion

-   a large fissile atomic nucleus (uranium-235, uranium-233, or
    plutonium-239) + a neutron --\> two or more lighter nuclei + kinetic
    energy + gamma radiation + free neutrons
-   free neutrons + new large fissile atomic nucleus --\> ...
-   nuclear chain reaction

## Heat generation

-   kinetic energy $\rightarrow$ thermal energy
-   absorbtion of gamma rays $\rightarrow$ thermal energy
-   radioactive decay

## Cooling

-   nuclear reactor coolant: water, gas metall, liquid metal (Ni or Pb),
    molten salt
-   disadvantages of using water as moderators
    -   results in too low neutron concentration
    -   relatively low boiling points
    -   inadequate cooling down in shut down mode

## Reactivity control

-   movement of the control rods made of neutron poisions --\> absorb
    neutrons
-   **In some reactors, the coolant acts like as a moderator.**
-   reactivity \> 1: increase exponentially; reactivity \< 1: decrease
    exponentially
-   control rods
    -   to control the rate of fission of the nuclear fuel
    -   capable of absorbing many neutrons without themselves decaying
    -   common used metal: boron (B), cadmium (Cd), silver (Ag), hafnium
        (Hf), indium (In)
    -   number of control rods, distance inserted --\> important factors

## Generation IV reactor

### Thermal reactors

-   use slow or thermal neutrons

1.  Very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR)

2.  Molten-salt reactor (MSR)

    -   works at high temperature and low pressure

3.  Supercritical-water-cooled reactor (SCWR)

    -   high thermal efficiency
    -   generation of low cost electricity

### Fast reactors

-   uses fission neutrons without moderation
-   energy above 1 MeV
-   no neutron moderator
-   rich fuel required
-   all fast reactors are cooled by liquid metals (coolant)
-   temperature in the core higher than thermal reactors
-   less heavy atoms in the waste stream
-   fast neutrons have a much lower probability of causing another
    fission than thermal neutrons

1.  Gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR)

    -   helium-cooled
    -   uses a direct Brayton cycle gas turbine for high thermal
        efficiency

2.  Sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR)

    -   The reactor design uses an unmoderated core running on fast
        neutrons, designed to allow any transuranic isotope to be
        consumed (and in some cases used as fuel)
    -   SFR fuel expands when the reactor overheats, automatically
        slowing down the chain reaction, making it passively safe.
    -   risks of handling sodium $\rightarrow$ explosive with water
    -   work at atmospheric pressure $\rightarrow$ reduces the leakage

3.  Lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR)

    -   is able to produce hydrogen

# Quick notes

## Why U-235 is used?

-   fissionable material and fissile material

-   fissionable material: high energy threshold

-   fissile material: no energy threshold

    -   only U-235 is a fissile material and exists in nature

## Safty strategies of a pressurized water reactor

-   this is the most common nuclear reactor type
-   strategies:
    1.  the cladding tube of the fuel
    2.  the high pressure system (the primary system)
    3.  the primary system located in a closed concrete bunker called a
        containment
