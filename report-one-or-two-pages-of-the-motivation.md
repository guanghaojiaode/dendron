# Introduction

In 1951, the first breeder reactor was built. In the 1960s and 1970s,
several SFRs were built. However, due to reasons for example some
accidents in SFRs, the success of the LWRs, and the illusion of adequate
fuel, the development of the SFRs was stopped since the late 1980s.

In the 21st century, with the ongoing global warming and the increase in
the [[radioactive-waste]]
produced by the LWRs, the R&D on the [[nuclear-reactor-generation-iv]] reemerged, aiming at
the development of revolutionary reactors with inherent safety features,
efficient utilization of the fuel and better management of the
radioactive waste. Among them, the sodium-cooled fast reactor (SFR) is
the most promising one, due to its long operation experience and
excellent thermal-physics performance of sodium.
