> Both the works mentioned above adopted single-phase flow formalism. The contributions of two-phase flow effects (i.e., interface momentum transfer and mixture inertia) due to argon mixing were not accounted for in the model formulation. The present work includes the two phase flow effects to understand the influence of two-phase effects on sodium-argon release from the reactor vessel. [^1]
