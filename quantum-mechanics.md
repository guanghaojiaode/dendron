Actually this is a subject that describes particles in a wave way.

The quantum mechanics is importatant in describing the nuclear. One
important feature of the quantum mechanics is \"discrete\". The energy
is regarded as discrete.

As we think that a particle appears in a box with a homogeneous
possobility, in quantum mechanics a particle appears in the box with a
inhomogenous possobility.

e.g.: The electrons around a nucleus can be regarded as the waves.
