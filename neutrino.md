At the beginning, thescientists thought, in beta decays, an electron, a
proton are emmited. However, a little mass was missing. Then a new
partical was found: Neutrino. It is neutral and has a very little mass.

The nuetrino are most penetrative radiation yet detected.

There is also antineutrino. And actually the relationship is very
complex.

# [TODO] What is the emmision in the beta decay?
