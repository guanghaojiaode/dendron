The Phénix (SFR) has already shut down. There are many things we can
learn from it.

- The first thing is the economic feature. We should not forget it.
- Also, the [[voiding-effects]] needs to be reduced.
- The [[doppler-effect]] should be increased.
- The loss of reactivity during the operation should be minimized.

> -   Reduction of the sodium void effect. The void coefficient in fast
>     neutron reactors is positive, which means that reactivity
>     increases if loss of sodium coolant occurs by boiling or gas
>     intrusion.

--\> To reduce the void coefficient is very important.

> Therefore the sodium void effect of core of the prototype must be of
> the same magnitude as the one of the commercial reactor, Camercat
> explained. For a core with height to diameter ratio of 0.25, a small
> core reactor (\~2.6m3) will have a void coefficient of the order of
> 500 pcm (1 pcm is a thousandth of a percent) and that a large core
> reactor (15.5m3) will have a void coefficient of the order of 1300
> pcm. In the case of an Unprotected Loss of Fluid Accident (ULOF), the
> small core can be stabilized by the prompt temperature coefficient due
> to the Doppler effect. But the larger core will not be, inducing early
> in the transient a power increase and a significant energy release.
> Therefore, to keep the same behaviour when going from prototype to
> commercial reactor, a larger core volume (at least 5.2m3) must be
> retained at the prototype scale to be able to extrapolate the safety
> analysis to the commercial scale.

--\> Although the ratio is the same, the scale is a problem. cite:
