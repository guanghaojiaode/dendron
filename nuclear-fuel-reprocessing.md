# Why should we reprocess the waste?

-   Actually we just use only a little bit energy of the total energy in
    the fuel.
-   The storage of the [Radioactive
    Waste](id:16df8af2-39a6-4b07-934b-0598b0ec0a9f) is hard.
-   So that we need to utilize the fuel as much as possible.

# Method

-   One typical method is PUREX Process (Plutonium and Uranium Recovery
    by extraction).
-   Other methods:
    -   UREX
    -   TRUEX
    -   SANEX
