The radioactive decay of an
[[isotope]] is unpredictable and
is random. But for many isotopes an average half-life of it can be
measured.

The neutron-induced decay of
[[uranium]] is different: It does
not simply emit energy and small particles like some other nucleis, but
it will be splitted into different big parts.
