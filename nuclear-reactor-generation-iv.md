The reactors of Generation IV contains generally [[very-high-temperature-reactor-vhtr]] and [[fast-reactor-fr]]. There are also [[molten-salt-reactor-msr]] and
[[supercritical-water-cooled-reactor-scwr]].

Why Generation IV?

1.  Inherently safe

2.  Retention of the fuel in the core --\> Prevent from nuclear weapons
    proliferation

3.  Higher operating temperature (typically 850-1000 Â°C) --\> higher
    thermal efficiency (efficiency of the thermal cycle: 45-50%)

4.  [[Thorium]]
-Uranium cycle
    --\> Thorium has more reserve than Uranium. (Cite: Nuclear Power: A
    very short introduction)

5.  Public perception concerns

6.  minimize and manage the nuclear waste (Cite: Nuclear Energy,
    Nicholas Tsoulfanidis, Page 177)
