The US firstly built a reactor in the type of [[pressured-water-reactors-pwrs]]. PWRs use the natural
water under high pressure as coolant. During the operation, the water
begins to be radioactive. A heat-exchanger is used to exchange the heat.
The other source of water in the exchanger is inradioactive and will
vapourize and drive the turbine and generate electricity.

From PWRs, a variation came up in the US. They are the [[boiling-water-reactors]] (BWRs). The BWRs work
at low pressure. They utilize directly the vapour generated from the
coolant. Therefore, they have higher heat efficiency than PWRs.

The PWRs and BWRs and some other reactors are also [[lighter-water-reactors]] (LWRs), which is
currently the dominating reactor over the world.

The UK develops the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGRs). It has higher
temperature and higher thermal efficiency.

They are all reactors of Generation II: PWRs, BWRs, AGRs ...
