The Enrichment of Uranium today is done by enriching Uranium in the high-speed centrifuges.

In the enrichment facility, there are plenty of rotating cylinders. The uranium is in the form of gaseous $UF_6$. The centrifuge force separates the U-238 and U-235. U-238 is thrown to the wall and U-235 is enriched in the center.
