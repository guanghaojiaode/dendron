(P. 168). The [[two-phase-flow]]
in SFR is one of the most important features in my research.

# Bubble Source

First, we should talk from the beginning, about how is the two-phase
flow generated.

Actually, it has two main sources.

## Externally introduced gases

--\> for more details see [[voiding-effects]]. There are some ways
to reduce the sodium void effect, for example, reducing the positive
spectral shift effect and/or enhancing the negative leakage increase
effect. (cite:
[@tommasiValidationSodiumVoid2010])

## Vaporization of the coolant

This subsubsection is cited from
[@schulenbergFourthGenerationNuclear2022]
(P. 100).

In normal operation, the sodium does not boil. It enters the core from
below at about 400 Celcius and exits the top at about 550 Celcius. So
there is a high safety margin between the operation temperature and the
boiling temperature of 883 Celcius.

However, in some special scenarios, the sodium could still boil.

But what happens to the [[two-phase-flow]] in this scenario? Do the
bubbles (sodium vapor) coalesce with each other?

2.  Specificities of SFR

    > One can see from this discussion that a fast reactor is in many

    > delayed neutrons. In addition, sodium can burn when it leaks.

# Generals

Any bubbles are dispersed by inlet plenum flows rather than concentrated
at a single point.

It is most unlikely that the externally introduced bubbles could have a
serious reactivity effect. But the very small bubbles will penetrate to
the core and their effects on the heat transfer should be considered.

--\> Focus on the heat transfer:

# Effects on the heat transfer

For homogeneous small bubbles, even if the void fraction is up to 50%,
there will be unlikely failures. And this void fraction is not
practical.

For the big bubbles, there will also be unlikely failures, but they may
insult some fuel pins.
