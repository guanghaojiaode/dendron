Doppler coefficient (DTC, FTC, fuel temperature coefficient) is defined
as the change in reactivity per degree change in the fuel temperature.
This is in reactors **always** a negative value.

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
\alpha_f = \frac{d\rho}{dT_f}
\end{equation}
```

This is one of the most significant coefficients for nuclear safety. It
reflects the reactor stability simultaneously. It is faster than the
[[moderator-temperature-coefficient-mtc]].

A negative DTC and MTC ensure stable power operation.

The change in reactivity due to the change in the fuel temperature is
called the doppler defect.

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
d\rho = \alpha \cdot dT
\end{equation}
```
