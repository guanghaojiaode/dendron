Nuclear cross section of a nucleus describes the probability that a
nuclear reaction occurs. Unit: barn. The nuclear cross section of
uranium-235 for slow thermal neutrons is about 1000 barns. For fast
neutrons, it is in the order of 1 barn.

It is interesting that the thermal neutrons have higher nuclear cross
section and interect more with the nucleus.

Nuclear cross section serves as the effective target area for the
collision of the particle and the nucleus. In reality there is no such
cross section.

```{=latex}
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{R}{I}
\end{equation}
```
$R$: number of the nuclear reaction per second. $I$: number of the
collisions between the particles and the slab per unit time per unit
area.
